# Privacy Mode
_PrivacyMode_ is a Box Type Preset introduced in v1.0.5 / 5.55.5. It can be selected when creating a new sandbox or in the "General Options" of an existing one. This preset is labeled "with data protection".

This mode makes all unsandboxed locations unreadable (except "C:\Windows" and "C:\Program Files"), hence denying programs access to any personal data. Also, the registry only allows reading of the machine and not user root keys. Exceptions can be specified in [Resource Access](ResourceAccess.md).
